# ML Model using SVM and Deploy using Flask
## Flask    
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) is a python module web framework that helps us develop web applications easily. It's easy to line up and straightforward to use. It's build around Werkzeug which is WSGI (Web server gateway interface) web applications interface and Jinja which is a templating engine for python programming language.

### Installation of Flask
For the user who have [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/) installed in there system there's no need to have install separately. Otherwise to install flask type the subsequent command `â€“ pip install flask` within the terminal.

> Since we'll be using SVM algorithm, to grasp more about it click [here](https://github.com/Learn-Write-Repeat/Intern-Work/tree/45ca8245e47186b679bcbb9b4006437d0b29828a/int-ml-4/Support%20Vector%20Machine).  

## Implementation
### Data Loading
```sh
#import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pickle

# Load the csv file
df = pd.read_csv("iris.csv")
df.head() #print the top 5 rows of the dataset
```
[![head](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/head.PNG?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/head.PNG)

The above figure shows the top 5 rows of the dataset. It contains 5 columns of which sepal lenght, sepal width, petal length, petal width are independent variables and species is dependent variable. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
```sh
# plotting the count plot of "Species"
sns.countplot(x="Species", data=df)
plt.title("Count plot for Species")
plt.show()
```
[![countplot](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/countplot_species.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/countplot_species.png)

There are total three Species namely "Setosa", "Versicolor" & "Virginica".

```sh
# Pair plot for pairwise relation
sns.pairplot(data=df, hue='Species')
```
[![pairplot](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/pairplot_species.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/pairplot_species.png)

The pairplot graph gives us the pair wair relationship, from the above graph we can see that "Setosa" species differ from the other two species in terms of relationship.

```sh
# Correlation among the attributes plotting using a HeatMap
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(),annot=True,fmt="f").set_title("Correlation of attributes with Species")
plt.show()
```
[![heatmap](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/heatmap.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/heatmap.png)

The 'Petal Width' and 'Petal Length' are correlated with each other and 'Sepal Width' and 'Sepal Length' are not correlated as shown in the heatmap.

```sh
# Bar plot for Sepal Length and Sepal Width
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 8))
plt.subplot(2,3,1)
sns.barplot(x="Species", y="Sepal_Length", data=df)
plt.subplot(2,3,2)
sns.barplot(x="Species", y="Sepal_Width", data=df)
plt.show()
```
[![sepal](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/barplot_sepal_lengthwidth.PNG?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/barplot_sepal_lengthwidth.PNG)

For the Sepal length "Virginica" are high while for Sepal width "Setosa" are high on number.

```sh
# Bar plot for Petal Length and Petal Width
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 8))
plt.subplot(2,3,1)
sns.barplot(x="Species", y="Petal_Length", data=df)
plt.subplot(2,3,2)
sns.barplot(x="Species", y="Petal_Width", data=df)
```
[![petal](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/barplot_petal_lengthwidth.PNG?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/barplot_petal_lengthwidth.PNG)

For both Petal length and Petal width "Virginica" have got the highest number with "Setosa" seems to the lowest on both.

### Model Building
```sh
# linear model
model_linear = SVC(kernel='linear')
model_linear.fit(X_train, y_train)

# predict
y_pred = model_linear.predict(X_test)

# confusion matrix and accuracy
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
# accuracy
print("accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred), "\n")

# cm
print(metrics.confusion_matrix(y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred))
```
[![linear](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/linear.PNG?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/linear.PNG)

The above figure shows the accuracy and confusion matrix for the linear model.

```sh
# non-linear model
# using rbf kernel, C=1, default value of gamma
non_linear_model = SVC(kernel='rbf')
non_linear_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# predict
y_pred = non_linear_model.predict(X_test)

# confusion matrix and accuracy
# accuracy
print("accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred), "\n")

# cm
print(metrics.confusion_matrix(y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred))
```
[![non-linear](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/nonlinear.PNG?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/nonlinear.PNG)

The above figure shows the accuracy and confusion matrix for the non-linear model.

##### Since the model performed better using kernel as rbf with an accuracy of 95% as compared to 93% for linear kernel. So we will go ahead with the rbf kernel i.e. Non-Linear model.

```sh
# Make pickle file for our model
pickle.dump(non_linear_model, open("model.pkl", "wb"))
```
The pickle file is being created which will be used by the deployment file (app.py) during routing for prediction.

##### The above coding is done using the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) however for deployment we will be shifting to [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) since we need to create a web application and a web server needs to be run for capturing the request from the user for prediction.  

### Deployment
```sh
# Import necessary liberies
import numpy as np
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, render_template
import pickle

# Create flask app
flask_app = Flask(__name__)
# Load the pickle model created from Jupyter Notebook
model = pickle.load(open("model.pkl", "rb"))

# Routing
@flask_app.route("/") #it will lend to the home page
def Home():
    return render_template("index.html")

@flask_app.route("/predict", methods = ["POST"]) #it will get the values entered by the user as POST method for prediction
def predict():
    float_features = [float(x) for x in request.form.values()]
    features = [np.array(float_features)]
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    return render_template("index.html", prediction_text = "The flower species is {}".format(prediction))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    flask_app.run(debug=True)
```
[![index](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/index.PNG?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/index.PNG)

The above figure shows the index page which is basically the home page. It is hosted locally at  `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. It is here we give our input data for prediction.  

[![predict](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/predicted.PNG?raw=true)](https://github.com/snozh5/temp/blob/main/Pictures_svm_deploy/predicted.PNG)

The above figure shows the predicted output post clicking the predict button.
